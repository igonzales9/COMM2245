Profile
My name is Isaiah Gonzales, and I am entering my last year for my BBA in MIS at Anderson. After that I would more than likely continue pursuing my Master’s in Cybersecurity.
About Me
In my free time I like to exercise and play golf and that is a credit to working at a golf course, I wasn't always a golfer but it’s a new found hobby that I have started and its much slower pace than I’m used to with other sports I have played but it’s a good past time to spend with your family and friends to have a good time. The picture I provided is from one of my favorite courses I got the opportunity to play this summer was in Show Low, Arizona called Birdie Ranch Golf Course. I played this course on a road trip with my dad to Phoenix; we left early in the morning played our round and then finished our road trip in the same day and my goal has become to play at least one course in every state during my lifetime.
